# Push
This is a simple program to send push notifications into your system.

The reason why I created it is that I needed something to remind me about stuff. 
Other tools I had installed didn't quite do the job and required more complex setting process and more manual management.

The program allows you to manage these things:

1. The title of the notification;
2. The message of the notification;
3. How long the notification is present by default;
4. How often the notification occurs.
